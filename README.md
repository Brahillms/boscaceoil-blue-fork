# Bosca Ceoil: The Blue Album

**Bosca Ceoil: The Blue Album** (or _Bosca Ceoil Blue_, for short) is a simple and beginner-friendly music making app. Using a step sequencer you can create anything from a simple beat to a complex melodic piece, using multiple synthesized instruments!

_Bosca Ceoil Blue_ is a modern port of **Terry Cavanagh's [Bosca Ceoil](https://github.com/TerryCavanagh/boscaceoil)**, and attempts to preserve everything that made the original so approachable and intuitive. And just like the original, _Bosca Ceoil Blue_ is absolutely free and provided under a permissive open source license, should you need to modify it.

## Features

**An intuitive piano roll sequencer.** Write music by playfully clicking on note blocks and experimenting with note arrangement.

**A pattern-based compositor.** Build patterns using the sequencer, and then drag and rearrange them on the timeline to compose a rich and complex melody.

**300+ synthesized instruments.** A variety of percussion, string, wind, MIDI, and synthwave instruments at your disposal.

**Export WAV and MID files.** Render out music that you've produced to share or to use in your game.

## Why _Bosca Ceoil_ needs a port?

Original _Bosca Ceoil_ is a great tool for budding musicians and game developers. It's almost perfect, but can still benefit from some UX enhancements and improvements to its composing features. It's also using an outdated technology stack which makes it hard to impossible to run it on modern systems, namely macOS and web.

The goal of the _Bosca Ceoil Blue_ project is to make _Bosca Ceoil_ more accessible to today's users and also to new contributors. We achieve this by reimplementing the entire application with a more modern set of tools, as a [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/) project.

A general-purpose game engine like Godot gives the project means to run on Linux, macOS, and Windows, as well as on web and even mobile phones â€” almost hassle-free. It's also a popular tool among many game developers, which should make _Bosca Ceoil Blue_ an inviting project for new collaborators.
